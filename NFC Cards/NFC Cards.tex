\subsubsection{Sizo Duma} 
\paragraph{}Course : BSc Information Technology (Software Development stream)
\paragraph{}Career Interest : Software & Systems Development/Engineering , Database Systems Development
\paragraph{}Skills : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Programming (C, C++, Java, C\#, XML)
\item Advanced Database Systems (Relational, Document \& Object Oriented)
\item Systems Design
\item Mobile Development (Android Studio)
\item Web Development (LAMP/WAMP)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Bio :}I started at the University of Pretoria in 2015 studying Computer Science. In second year I decided to switch to the BSc Information Technology program which allowed me to take Computer Science along with Informatics as a second major. I did this because while I am highly passionate about the deeper back-end development that Computer Science offers in depth, I also love business. I particularly the business aspect of IT along with front-end development, and wish to attain as much knowledge as I can about: systems development, front-end development, and back-end development which are all catered for best in BSc Information Technology (Software Development). I am passionate about what I am studying which makes putting in the extra effort to always produce a perfect product that much easier.

\paragraph{Bio :} I came out of high school and went into computer engineering for a year and a half, after only enjoying the computer science modules, I decided it was time to make a change. Since that change, I have grown to love almost all things computer science, and have never been happier.
In my spare time I tend to enjoy video games, series and movies. But otherwise, I take great pleasure in programming--nothing better than a good challenge--or other computer related things; like when you have over 60 mods (it's not many I know) in skyrim and it all works--then you realise that that's actually the best part of the game; or learning Dvorak was great fun; blender's my on and off again lover; installing and configuring an operating system is always a hoot--speaking of: it's time I installed Arch again. . .

\section{Motivation For Project}
When deciding what projects to bid for, each team member suggested three projects which they were interested in. The NFC Business Cards tender is the only project that every team member had a mutual interest in, and was individually suggested by every member. This common interest increases the chances of project success as well as the chance of producing a top-level application as we are all willing to go the extra mile on this project, hence this is our first choice project.
\newline
\newline Every team member also has skills that will contribute to making this a successful project. The team has members who major in Computer Science, Informatics, Mathematics & Multimedia. The Multimedia members will focus on the front-end development of the project and produce a system with a flawless user experience and interface. The Mathematics and some Computer Science team members will be ... (still to be completed) 
\newline
\newline We are the best choice for this project because of our diverse skills and excellent team work. With our common interest in this project we aim at doing our best to meet all the client's requirements and exceed expectations.
