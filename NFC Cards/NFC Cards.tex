\subsection{The Team}




\subsubsection{Sizo Duma} 
\paragraph{}Course : BSc Information Technology (Software Development stream)
\paragraph{}Career Interest : Software & Systems Engineering, Moblie Application Developer 
\paragraph{}Skills : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Programming (C, C++, Java, C\#, XML)
\item Advanced Database Systems (Relational, Document \& Object Oriented)
\item Systems Design
\item Mobile Development (Android Studio)
\item Web Development (LAMP/WAMP)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Bio :}I started at the University of Pretoria in 2015 studying Computer Science. In second year I decided to switch to the BSc Information Technology program which allowed me to take Computer Science along with Informatics as a second major. I did this because while I am highly passionate about the deeper back-end development that Computer Science offers targets. I also like business. I particularly like the business aspect of IT along with front-end development, and wish to attain as much knowledge as I can about: systems development, front-end development, and back-end development which are all catered for best in BSc Information Technology (Software Development). I am passionate about what I am studying which makes putting in the extra effort to always produce a perfect product that much easier. 

\subsubsection{John Ojo}
\paragraph{}Course : BSc Information Technology \& Applied Mathematics
\paragraph{}Career Interest : Software Developments/Engineering, Financial/System Analyst
\paragraph{}Skills : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Programming (C++, Java, MATLAB, SAS, Assembly)
\item Web development
\item Database Systems (Relational)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Bio :} Since the beginning of my degree I have been looking forward to doing 
Software Engineering. I wanted to combine different systems, mix the old 
and the new and especially combine mathematics and Information 
Technology. Mathematics has been the one subject that has been getting 
the best of students since the beginning and IT is the new world that 
everyone wants to be part of. I chose to do both to truly defeat something 
that has challenged to students and join the world of IT where concepts 
and theories were made possible. I want to work with different people, 
create things that were just thoughts and improve life as a whole. IT gives 
me that opportunity.

\subsubsection{Kevin Reid}
\paragraph{}Course : BSc Computer Science
\paragraph{}Career Interest : Software Development, Game Development
\paragraph{}Skills : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Programming: C, C++, Java, Assembly (x86), HTML, JavaScript, CSS, MySQL (MariaDB), PHP, XML, BASH, ZSH, LaTeX.
\item GNU/Linux (Debian and Arch based)
\item 3D modelling and texturing (Blender)
\item Circuitry and Electronics
\item LAMP Stack
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Bio :} I came out of high school and went into computer engineering for a year and a half, after only enjoying the computer science modules, I decided it was time to make a change. Since that change, I have grown to love almost all things computer science, and have never been happier.
In my spare time I tend to enjoy video games, series and movies. But otherwise, I take great pleasure in programming--nothing better than a good challenge--or other computer related things; like when you have over 60 mods (it's not many I know) in skyrim and it all works--then you realise that that's actually the best part of the game; or learning Dvorak was great fun; blender's my on and off again lover; installing and configuring an operating system is always a hoot--speaking of: it's time I installed Arch again. . .

\section{Motivation For Project}
When deciding what projects to bid for, each team member suggested three projects which they were interested in. The NFC Business Cards tender is the only project that every team member had a mutual interest in, and was individually suggested by every member. This common interest increases the chances of project success as well as the chance of producing a top-level application as we are all willing to go the extra mile on this project, hence this is our first choice project.
\newline
\newline Every team member also has skills that will contribute to making this a successful project. The team has members who major in Computer Science, Informatics, Mathematics & Multimedia. The Multimedia & Informatics members will focus on the front-end development of the project and produce a system with a flawless user experience and interface. The Mathematics and some Computer Science team members will be more focused on the backend part of the system, such as security.
\newline
\newline We are the best choice for this project because of our diverse skills and excellent team work. With our common interest in this project we aim at doing our best to meet all the client's requirements and exceed expectations.

\section{The Project}
\subsection{High Level Description}
The project is to develop a efficient and effective system of electronic business cards making use of devices such as our smart phones and 3rd party electronic NFC cards. The System should be able to gather potential client details seamlessly with the use of NFC technology and automate features such as sending fist contact mail, and adding relevant contact info either your email address book or contact book. The system should also be able to extend to other social media platforms such as Linked In, Facebook and more.
\newline
\newline The following requirements will be met : 
\begin{itemize}
\item The ability to seamlessly transfer contact (business card) data  between two devices.
\item Automation of general tasks such as first contact mail between first time interactions.
\item A safe and secure platform for data gathering & sharing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Domain Model}

\subsection{Technologies To Be Used}
\begin{itemize}
\item NFC Enabled Smart Mobile Phones
\item Android Studio For App Development
\item Java For Backend Development
\item Android SQLlite/MySQL
\item Other: 3rd party NFC enabled cards 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Development Methodology}
\paragraph{} We will be utilising \textbf{Agile} development methodologies with specific reference to \textbf{SCRUM} practices. We believe that this is the best means to enable both us as the engineering team and the client to focus on effectively performing the tasks integral to successfully providing the desired mobile application For this project. EPI-USEy will take the part as Product Owner and us as Binary Ninjaz will be the Development Team. 

\paragraph{} \newline
Interactions are highly valued by our team, hence we are dedicated to conducting weekly or bi-weekly meetings with EPI\_USE to ensure we are oncourse with the clients expectations.This will also serve and start and end points for Sprints (which serve as schedules for delivery of agreed upon requirements) . We will also be regularly meeting and consulting with our lectures and tutors for further guidance throughout the duration of the project. All of the above mentioned parties will have access a third party instant messaging platform in order to facilitate communication apart from physical meetings.


\paragraph{} \newline
A collaborative and cooperative approach between both stakeholders will be employed for the life span of the project. There will also be a focus on the frequent, iterative presentation of small, incremental releases of deliverables to the client. The role of EPI-USE
in this approach includes:
%\paragraph{}Skills : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Active involvement and collaboration in all phases of project
\item Analysis and Design - The client will facilitate the identification, definition,
prioritisation and continuous refinement of high level requirements, system
architecture and design decisions of the mobile application in order to ensure
the correct functionality of the end product.
\item Development and Deployment - The client will periodically review all instances
of the product in order to ensure to it is in line with their expectations
\item Critical and constructive analysis on not only what we as the engineering team
deliver but also on the quality of our service and whether or not we conducted
ourselves as would be expected from those in a occupational environment
\item To provide us with the means to produce an effective end product. An exhaustive
list of these required means will be provided in further Analysis and Design
specification.
\end{itemize}
