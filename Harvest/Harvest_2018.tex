	\section*{Development Methodology}
	We are a diverse group of students from studies that all have a different focus. We intend to combine all of our own unique development strategies in-order to build the best and most understood application possible. We believe that everything can be made easier. And we enjoying making it so! We see your problem as being perfectly catered towards having an elegant solution. Data capturing user interfaces we one of the very first problems people needed to solve, which means we have a lot of history and design principles to guide us towards an optimal solution. The hardest part of creating a great data capturing user experience is understanding the work flow of the capturers. To accomplish this we will require interviews with the participants using the application and interface. We believe this will allow us a true understanding, which will allow us to build the perfect system.
	
	\section*{Who We Are}
	\subsection*{Letanyan Arumugam}
	I am currently a 3rd-year student at the University of Pretoria studying BSc. Computer Science. In my spare time, I'm an 	active member of the Swift-Evolution community, which deals with the language design of, the programming language, Swift. With Swift, I have created applications that have were published on the Apple App Store. Building these apps allows me to do a few things that I enjoy. These would be algorithm optimisation, user experience and designing an excellent looking user interface.
